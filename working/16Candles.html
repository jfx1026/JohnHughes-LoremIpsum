"Chop chop.",
"We’ve got relatives invading this afternoon.",
"Jenny! Mike! Sara! Sam!",
"Come on! Everybody up! ",

"Make me.",
"Dad! Mike hit me! ",
"You liar. ",
"Mike, come on pal!",
"We’ve got a wedding tomorrow.",
"Try to cooperate. ",
"Dad, I didn’t hit her.",
"I’d like to very much, and I probably will later, but give me a break.",
"You know my methods.",
"I don’t hit her when you’re just down the hall. ",
"Pick on someone your own size.",
"Open this door. ",
"Daddy, I’m the one getting married. ",
"Not until tomorrow.",
"Come on, I’ve got a mouthful of toothpaste. ",
"I happen to have a serious problem.",
"Dad, she got her period.",
"Should make for an interesting honeymoon, huh? ",
"Where’re you learning that stuff? ",
"School. ",
"Good. I’m getting my money’s worth. "

"Chronologically you’re sixteen today.",
"Physically you’re still 15.",
"Hopeless.",
"Nope, I look exactly the same as I have since summer, utterly forgettable.",
"No, I didn’t expect to wake up transformed.",
"I just thought that turning sixteen would be so major that I would wake up with an improved metal state that would show on my face.",
"All it shows is that I don’t have any sort of a tan left.",
"I better get downstairs.",
"My family’s probably pissed off I haven’t let them wish me Happy Birthday yet.",
"All right. I’ll see you at school.",
"You need four inches of bod and a great birthday."

"Where’s my briefcase?",
"Where’d you leave it.",
"Don’t be a smart ass.",
"Okay I’ll be a dumb ass.",
"Okay, where’s Sam?",
"Where’s my briefcase?",
"Sam!",
"Allow me, Brenda.",
"You missed breakfast again.",
"It wasn’t my idea to give her her own phone line.",
"I don’t have my own phone line.",
"It’s small, it’s brown, it’s made of leather, it has my initials on it.",
"I believe...that’s it.",
"Don’t forget, the grandparents are coming this afternoon.",
"Are we still having dinner with the Riesczecks?",
"Riesczecks. 8:00 at the Club.",
"Oh, and you better learn their names, as of tomorrow they’re family.",
"That’s a lovely thought.",
"When it comes your turn to get married, do me a favor, elope.",
"Who’d marry her? ",
"Mr. T.",
"I’m sorry, you’ll have to buy lunch today, I didn’t have time to fix your carrots.",
"She’s only eating carrots to increase the size of her breasts.",
"Mister, you had better shape up or you will miss your sister’s wedding.",
"Promise?",
"Now don’t give me that pouty look of yours.",
"You can eat your carrots when you get home.",
"That’s it?",
"You don’t have anything else to say to me today?",
"What would you like to say, Sam?",
"Come on now honey, you’re gonna miss the bus.",
"Have a good day.",
"I can’t believe this. They fucking forgot my birthday."


"I’m sure they didn’t forget your birthday.",
"They just didn’t remember it right away.",
"Same difference.",
"I know it’s a drag that your sweet sixteen’s the day before Jenny gets married but big deal, they’ll remember.",
"Oh, easy for you to say.",
"Did anyone ever forget your birthday?",
"Sam.",
"Everything’s getting shittier.",
"My family forgetting my birthday just makes it more vivid.",
"Well what do you expect, a breakfast birthday party?",
"No, but they could have at least said Happy Birthday.",
"I mean it was just like any other day.",
"Why don’t you remind them?",
"They’ll feel some massive guilt, it could be highly profitable.",
"I wouldn’t stoop to remind them.",
"Since I was about twelve I’ve been looking forward to my sweet sixteen.",
"You know, a big party and a band, tons of people...",
"...and big TransAm in the driveway with a ribbon around it...and some incredibly gorgeous guy that you meet like in France, and you could do it on a cloud without getting pregnant or herpes. ",
"I don’t need the cloud.",
"Just a big TransAm and a guy right?",
"A black one.",
"A black guy?",
"A black TransAm, a pink guy.",
"Oh no. "


"You swear to God you don’t have it?",
"I don’t know anything about it.",
"Jennifer Woods gave me a Sex test during Child Development and I was supposed to do it and pass it to you in Independent Study.",
"I’m totally screwed.",
"Did you have your name on it?",
"Hi.",
"Hi.",
"No. But it was really embarrassing.",
"I had to name who I’d do it with if I ever did it.",
"Who’d you name?",
"Jake Ryan.",
"Jake Ryan? He doesn’t even know you exist.",
"Thank you, that’s a very nice thing to say.",
"I’m sorry, but Jake Ryan?",
"He’s a Senior, and he’s taken.",
"I mean really taken.",
"I know. He’s supposed to be my ideal.",
"He’s ideal for sure, but forget it.",
"God, I hope whoever got that note doesn’t know it was me who wrote it.",
"I’d shit twice and die."

 
"Do you know Samantha Baker?",
"Sophomore, right?",
"Yeah, what do you think of her?",
"I don’t.",
"Would you go out with her?",
"Depends on how much you paid me.",
"She’s not ugly.",
"There’s nothing there, man.",
"It’s not ugly, it’s just void.",
"You know what I mean?",
"There’s something about her.",
"I do independent study with her, I catch her looking at me a lot.",
"It’s kinda cool the way she’s always looking at me.",
"Maybe she’s retarded.",
"I’m being serious.",
"Okay.",
"She looks at me like she’s in love with me.",
"Jake, she’s a child.",
"So?",
"So what are you gonna do with her?",
"She’s obviously too young to party serious.",
"Maybe I’m interested in more than a party.",
"Come on, Jake. You talk like you’re hard up.",
"You got Caroline, now she’s a woman."

 
"Unbelievable.",
"I swear Caroline Mulford had to flunk about nine grades.",
"Truly makes me ill.",
"She’s perfect.",
"Practically impossible to cut up.",
"She’s supposedly real sweet, her brother’s deaf, and everybody in the world worship’s her.",
"And she’s going with Jake.",
"I’m gonna kill myself."


"My man!",
"I loathe the bus.",
"There has to be a more dignified mode of transportation.",
"I hope you get a car for your birthday, and a license. ",
"Let’s not hold our breath.",
"Score! A direct hit.",
"On second thought..."


"Call me, okay?",
"You call me first.",
"Tell me what happened at home.",
"I can tell you right now, nothing.",
"Will you stop feeling sorry for yourself.",
"It’s bad for your complexion."


"How’s it going?",
"How’s what going?",
"You know, things, life, whatnot.",
"Life is not whatnot, and it’s none of your business.",
"So you going to the dance tonight?",
"That’s also none of your business.",
"Are you inhibited about dancing in public?",
"You don’t have to dance.",
"You could just stand there with me and my dudes, and just be you.",
"Sounds major.",
"So what’s the story, you got a guy or what?",
"Yes, three big ones and they lust wimp blood, so quit bugging me or I’ll sick them all over your weenie ass.",
"You know I’m getting input here that I’m reading is relatively hostile.",
"I mean I just...",
"Go to hell.",
"Very hostile.",
"Come on, what’s the problem here, I’m a boy, you’re a girl...is there something wrong with my trying to put together some kind of relationship between us.",
"Okay look, I know you have to go, just answer me one question.",
"Yes, you’re a total fag.",
"That wasn’t the question.",
"Am I turning you on?",
"It’s encouraging, very encouraging.",
"Uh-huh.",
"You know a girl with a hat is just...whoa...vogue.",
"Uh...yeah."


"Where are my blue socks, Dorothy?",
"Do you mean to tell me you didn’t pack them?",
"Oh, not again Howard.",
"Can’t I trust you to do anything?",
"Do you expect me to do all the packing?",
"Well at least I packed this for you.",
"Sam!",
"Samantha.",
"Look.",
"Oh.",
"Hi.",
"Hi!",
"Oh God.",
"Oh, sweetheart, my goodness are you a sight for sore eyes.",
"Oh, how are you my little lamb chop?",
"I’m fine, Grandpa.",
"How are you guys?",
"Oh, we’re pretty good.",
"Oh, I got the lower back pain...",
"Well, my corns are killing me...and I still have those headaches, but I brought the ice bag so...",
"So are you guys sleeping up here?",
"Yeah. Your Grandfather Fred jumped our claim on Sara’s room so here we are.",
"Well I haven’t seen you guys in a while, do I look any older today?",
"No, I wouldn’t say so.",
"Would you?",
"No. Oh, I hope it isn’t cold tomorrow.",
"You know Jenny, she’ll refuse to wear a hat and a coat over her wedding dress.",
"Well, if she does you mustn’t bug her...",
"Well, I’m not gonna bug her...",
"Well, I’m gonna go set myself up in Mike’s room.",
"So I’ll see you guys later.",
"Okay sweetheart.",
"Grandpa and I are looking forward to a nice long, long visit with you.",
"Oh we certainly are.",
"I swear to God, this has got to be a joke.",
"Grandparents forgetting a birthday?",
"They live for that shit. ",
"Well, well...if it isn’t Sammy Baker Davis Junior.",
"Hi Grandpa.",
"Oh, I’ve got one for you.",
"Knock knock.",
"Who’s there?",
"Who.",
"Who who?",
"Helen, we’ve got an owl out here in the hall.",
"Fred, leave her alone.",
"You’ll make her tinkle.",
"Oh, come on Helen.",
"Oh Sam, let me look at you.",
"Fred, she’s gotten her boobies.",
"Oh, I better go get my magnifying glass.",
"Oh, and they are so perky.",
"I can’t believe my Grandmother actually felt me up.",
"What’s happening hot stuff?"


"His name is Long Duck Dong.",
"What?",
"Long Duck Dong.",
"He came down with Grandma and Grandpa Baker.",
"He’s an exchange student that’s living with them.",
"Yeah, well he’s totally bizarre.",
"He is not!",
"He is a very sweet boy.",
"I just hope we burn the sheets and mattresses after he leaves.",
"I don’t suppose it makes any difference to you but there’s a very weird Chinese guy up in Mike’s room.",
"Jenny dumped Rudy, he’s her new fiancée.",
"Mike, stop it.",
"Sam, honey, do you think you can help the grandmother’s with supper?",
"Dad and I have to go to the Club for dinner with the Riesczecks.",
"Riesczecks.",
"Oh Riesczecks.",
"Do you think there’s any reason that I should possibly stay home tonight?",
"Well, I think it might be nice if you visit with your Grandparents and Long Duck Dong.",
"Who?",
"The weird Chinese guy in Mike’s room.",
"I think I have a dance to go to.",
"Well that’s okay.",
"Oh can you remember to turn off the stove in 20 minutes.",
"I can remember lots of things.",
"This is the single worst day of my entire life.",
"What the hell are you bitchin’ about?",
"I gotta sleep under a Chinaman named after a ducks dork.",
"Well where am I sleeping?",
"Sofa city, sweetheart."


"Do you think Grandpa Fred’s going to embarrass me?",
"I don’t know why not, he does to everyone else.",
"He already asked me if Rudy was the oily variety bohunk.",
"Is he?",
"Don’t be cute.",
"I really love Rudy, and he is totally enamored of me.",
"I mean, I’ve had men who’ve loved me before, but not for six months in a row.",
"I think I’m in love.",
"So, how long have you been in love?",
"Well it hasn’t really happened yet.",
"So what’s the deal?",
"I’m not sure that he knows I exist. ",
"Sam, I really don’t have time for this.",
"Well I’m sorry.",
"I always listen to you talk about your boyfriends.",
"Darling, is something bothering you?",
"You’re really acting like...an asshole.",
"And I think I know what it is.",
"I think you’re jealous that I’m getting married and that I’m getting all the attention.",
"You know everyone in this family has just gone totally outer limits.",
"No, Sam, I think you’re just being a little selfish and immature.",
"Oh yes, that’s it.",
"That’s exactly it.",
"Unbelievable.",
"You make someone a bridesmaid and they shit all over you."


"Very clever dinner.",
"Appetizing food fitting neatly into interesting round pie.",
"It’s a quiche. ",
"How you spell?",
"Well you don’t spell it son, you eat it.",
"Dong has only been in our country a short time, Fred.",
"I think we can all help him assimilate.",
"Oh...",
"Long Duck Dong is about your age Sam.",
"You two should have a lot to chat about.",
"I love visiting with Grandma and Grandpa, and writing letters to parents, and pushing lawn mowing machine so Grandpa’s hyena don’t get disturbed.",
"Hernia.",
"Oh, yes indeedy.",
"He does the dishes and helps with the laundry, you betcha.",
"May I be excused.",
"Where are you going?",
"I have dance to go to, at school.",
"It’s a very important dance.",
"We’re being graded on it, for gym.",
"Wait a minute, I have a wonderful idea.",
"Would you like to go to the dance with Sam?"


"I wonder if Jake’s here.",
"I don’t think it’s too healthy to get all jacked up about some guy that isn’t even a thing yet.",
"Yeah, well when you don’t have anything you don’t have anything to lose, right?",
"That’s a cheerful thought.",
"Let’s go make ourselves available.",
"That’s the one, dude. Scope it out.",
"She doesn’t look like a Freshman.",
"Sophomore, dude, Sophomore.",
"Fully aged Sophomore meat.",
"Dude, we bus together.",
"You talked to her?",
"Talk? Dude, I have a relationship with her.",
"Figure it to be seventeen digits.",
"You are such a liar.",
"We’ll see about that, my man.",
"By night’s end I predict me and her will interface.",
"All right, I knew you’d come around.",
"Break dance, sister.",
"Very hot, very hot.",
"Tonight, tonight is happening.",
"I’m blowing your mind aren’t I?",
"Way to go dick face, she took off.",
"Don’t spaz out, okay Wheez.",
"The situation will come online.",
"Yeah? I’ll bet you a dozen floppy disks you don’t even get tit.",
"You got a bet, scum bag.",
"Get it all.",
"You wouldn’t be able to prove it anyway.",
"A, don’t hit me.",
"Secondly, what kind of proof do you want?",
"Video.",
"No way, okay?",
"I could just see the thing getting duped a thousand times and like winding up on cable somewhere.",
"Try again.",
"Underpants.",
"No problem, butt lick.",
"Girls underpants."


"So, what’s your name?",
"Dong.",
"What’s your first name?",
"Long.",
"What’s your middle name?",
"Duck.",
"I bet all the boys chase you plenty in the school, huh?",
"Nobody’s caught me yet.",
"I bet you big teaser.",
"No, I can run the 40 in five flat.",
"Flat?"


"I’m really sorry.",
"Whatever I did was an accident.",
"I mean...I...",
"Relax.",
"You were dancing with a girl.",
"Oh man, I’m really sorry.",
"I must have been on drugs five minutes ago.",
"I didn’t even know what I was...",
"Do you know her?",
"She grabbed me guy.",
"I’m totally innocent.",
"Is she yours?",
"What do you know about her?",
"She has smallish tits, decent voice, smells pretty good.",
"She drives me crazy.",
"Did she come here with you?",
"No, no.",
"But if it’s okay with my dad she’s coming home with me.",
"Excuse me."


"Do you guys want to blow off this dance?",
"Yes.",
"I'm bored...",
"And go where?",
"Well, Jake’s parents aren’t home, we could do it at his house.",
"How’s it going?",
"Fine.",
"Let’s party light though.",
"Jake’s paranoid about his parent’s house getting trashed.",
"Again."


"Yes, I’m back.",
"So I smelled.",
"That’s my shaving cream.",
"Wanna feel a real clean, close shave?",
"I’ll pass.",
"Couldn’t find anyone else to bug huh?",
"Come on, you know you’re the one I wanna bug.",
"This is my friend Randy and that’s Jimmy Montrose.",
"Hey dude.",
"This is Farmer Fred.",
"Ted.",
"Oh, I’m sorry, this is Farmer Ted.",
"I’m not really a farmer, I’m a Freshman.",
"Geek, can I be honest with you?",
"Not if you’re gonna insult me.",
"Okay.",
"Shoot.",
"Get the hell outta here.",
"Nice, nice manners babe.",
"She’s totally serious, ass wipe.",
"Chill.",
"I dunno...they tell me...",
"I can’t handle this.",
"...if you want something you have to go for it.",
"I’m not the type of guy...it’s embarrassing..."


"I’m sorry about what happened in the gym.",
"I had no idea you couldn’t dance.",
"What a decent night, huh?",
"It’s my birthday.",
"You say it’s your birthday...bah nah nah... it’s my birthday too...",
"Don’t be an idiot okay?",
"Hey Jude...",
"Just stop it okay.",
"I mean it’s really been a shitty birthday for me, no offense, but I don’t really need a serenade right now.",
"What’s wrong, you didn’t get anything good?",
"I didn’t get shit.",
"Not even Happy Birthday.",
"My whole family kind of blew it off.",
"I’d freak if my family forgot my birthday.",
"It’s a brand new year, I’m sixteen, everything should be platinum.",
"I should be happy, right? Right?",
"Yeah.",
"Well I can’t get happy.",
"It’s physically impossible for me to get happy.",
"Would you feel better if you knew one of my secrets?",
"Don’t gross me out.",
"No, we’re not talking gross.",
"No, it’s just embarrassing.",
"This information cannot leave this room, okay?",
"It would devastate my reputation as a dude.",
"No problem. ",
"I’ve never bagged a babe.",
"I’m not a stud.",
"I got the rep in sixth grade, and it like stuck with me.",
"Look, I’d appreciate you not laughing.",
"Okay?",
"I’m sorry.",
"That’s not what I meant, I meant...",
"Hey, back off Junior.",
"Pardon me.",
"It’s okay.",
"I mean that it’s okay you did it once, I didn’t mean for you to do it again!",
"I’m sorry.",
"I’m sorry.",
"You know just now I really felt how much you liked me.",
"You’re probably zoning in on my brain waves or something.",
"Not really, I felt it on my leg.",
"Come on!",
"I don’t want to see it!",
"Oh, sorry if I embarrassed you.",
"I’m not embarrassed.",
"Fresh breath is the priority of my life.",
"You know I really don’t want to hurt your feelings cause it’s really human of you to listen to all my bull shit.",
"I care about it, really.",
"I mean, I know I kinda came on like a cruiser on the bus tonight and everything, but that’s just so my friends won’t think I’m a jerk.",
"But they’re all pretty much jerks though, aren’t they?",
"Yeah, but the thing is I’m kinda like the leader.",
"Kind of like the King of the Dipshits.",
"Well that’s pretty cool.",
"Hey, but a lot can happen over a year.",
"I mean, you could come back next fall as a completely normal person.",
"Yeah? ",
"Sure.",
"Would it be totally off the wall if...if I asked if I could have sex with you?",
"You know, you asking is not as off the wall as why I won’t.",
"VD?",
"No. I’m sort of saving myself.",
"It’s really stupid, he doesn’t even know I exist.",
"Who?",
"Who? ",
"Jake Ryan.",
"You like Jake?",
"Jake’s my boy.",
"I just talked to Jake in the gym.",
"He asked me about you.",
"He did not!",
"He did too!",
"He did.",
"He asked what you were like.",
"Oh my g...if you’re lying I’ll beat the crap out of you.",
"I’m not lying.",
"Oh my God, what should I do?",
"Should I go up to him and say Hi Jake, I’m Samantha, or no, maybe I should let him come to me.",
"This is not my department.",
"But what if I decide to let him come to me and then he forgets?",
"Or then what if he changes his mind, then I’m totally screwed, right?",
"Apparently so.",
"Well what would you do if you were me?",
"I’m a gambling man by nature, and, uh I’d go for it.",
"This is so strange but I think I will.",
"Oh, you’re the best.",
"Wait, um...",
"What?",
"Do you know anything about floppy disks?",
"Um, we’ll talk about this on the bus, okay?",
"Well, no, see the thing is I’ve got kind of a problem.",
"Floppy disks are pretty expensive and the thing is I made a bet with my friends, the dipshits, I bet them that I could do it with you.",
"But was before I knew you as a person.",
"I can get proof without actually getting physical.",
"How? ",
"Can I borrow your underpants for ten minutes?"


"I think it’s time to blow this thing off and go to your house.",
"Yeah?",
"I told Tracy and Robin and those guys to come to your parents house, okay?",
"I told them not to tell anyone.",
"God I love it when your parents are out of town.",
"I fantasize that I’m your wife and we’re like the richest and most popular adults in town.",
"I owe all my great weekends to you.",
"What’s your problem?",
"What?",
"You’ve been acting weird all night.",
"Are you screwing around?",
"Me?",
"Are you crazy?",
"I don’t know, Jake.",
"I’m getting strange signals.",
"Well they’re not coming from me.",
"Look, everything’s fine.",
"Don’t have a cow.",
"Okay, just remember one thing, I can name 20 guys who would kill to love me.",
"Is that a threat?",
"It’s a fact, Jake.",
"Come on, before we get in a big wicked fight, let’s get outta here."


"Hi, Jake, I’m Samantha.",
"How’s it going.",
"Do you got a cigarette?",
"Jake, this may sound incredibly dumb, but I love you and I’ll do anything to make you love me.",
"I love your shirt.",
"Jake, you’re not gonna believe this but I had this very bizarre dream and you were in it.",
"I can’t believe I’m such a jerk.",
"He smiles at me and I don’t say anything.",
"And I can’t believe I gave my panties to the geek."


"What year are you?",
"Freshman.",
"Give me a buck.",
"Get in.",
"Shut up!",
"Bryce. ",
"Ted.",
"Go for it."


"Hey, uh, listen, I wanna thank you for loaning me the Donger.",
"He’s really bitchin’.",
"It’s okay, you guys make a great couple.",
"I’ve never been so happy in my whole life.",
"You maniac.",
"Now I have a place to put my hand."


"So basically, Jimmy, my business is video game arcades, laundry and cigarette machines and trucking.",
"I dabble a little bit in personal loans and politics.",
"Very nice.",
"I think all that really matters is that the kids are happy together.",
"Just as long as my beautiful boy remembers that marrying this one means he’s out of the girl of the month club.",
"Hey, wait a minute, I still can look.",
"I just can’t touch. Right?",
"Oh, sensitive.",
"Cheers.",
"Right on!",
"You do shots?",
"Come on, wolf it."


"Uh, good night Marlene.",
"See you later, Dong.",
"Sammy, tell Grandpa not to wait up.",
"Let’s go boogie.",
"Sure.",
"Donger’s here for five hours and he’s got somebody.",
"I live here my whole life and I’m like a disease."


"Everybody, I’d like you to meet my boyfriend, Jake.",
"Jake, this is...everybody.",
"All right...who’s is this?",
"Such a poop."


"Oh shit, Ted, that’s my mom.",
"I gotta get home. ",
"Change your frequency, okay, don’t be such a wimp.",
"Take those ridiculous things off, okay.",
"Will you guys grow up?",
"Ted, won’t we get pounded if we go to a Senior party?",
"Wheeze, we’ve got $70 dollars and a pair of girls underpants.",
"We’re as safe as kittens, okay?",
"This is a great social opportunity for us.",
"Come on!",
"Do not embarrass me, okay?",
"Well sure we will.",
"Will you fix your hair, Bryce.",
"I already did.",
"Wheeze, close your bone, all right.",
"And be polite to his parents okay?",
"Okay.",
"Hey, come on it!",
"The party’s hot, dude, person.",
"He’s from outta town...he speaks English, all right?",
"Don’t be such faggots!",
"Man shut up!",
"Kidding.",
"Sorry.",
"You think we’re gonna die?",
"Definitely."


"Did you let the cat out?",
"We don’t have a cat.",
"Come on, damn it, answer.",
"Oh eat me.",
"Who is it?",
"Well what did they want?",
"Sex.",
"Very nice!",
"We’re here five minutes and the...I’m at a loss.",
"Real smooth Cliff."


"You know, I’ve never been out with a boy before.",
"Me neither."


"Jake?",
"Where are you Jake?",
"Jakey, have you stopped loving me?",
"Leave me alone!",
"What? I’m sorry, I don’t do that! ",
"Yes you do!",
"I know.",
"Come on, let’s go.",
"Trace...you guys, can you help me please?",
"Come on, I’m your Prom Queen.",
"Trace, you guys, I’m serious, come on, I need help.",
"What’s the problem?",
"Several things.",
"Okay, no problem.",
"Don’t go away, Caroline baby."


"Hello!",
"Hello?",
"Listen, I know you’re there I can hear you breathing.",
"Yes, hello sir, um...",
"Are you the little bugger that’s been calling here all night and hanging up?",
"Would it be possible for you to tell me if there is a Samantha Baker there, and if so, sir, may I converse with her briefly?",
"Yes it is, and no you may not.",
"Might I leave a message, sir?",
"He wants to leave a message for Sam.",
"Give me that phone.",
"Now you listen to me, mister.",
"God did not put me on this earth to be awakened by filthy suggestions from a foul mouth hooligan like you.",
"And as for our granddaughter, I’m sure that she has more than enough sense to stay clear of the likes of you.",
"Now good night and good bye!",
"That was great. ",
"Sam’s lucky she has us, Howard.",
"Yeah, even if she doesn’t appreciate us."


"You promise you won’t get mad?",
"No, I love you.",
"Okay, close your eyes.",
"I don’t know how to thank you enough.",
"My pleasure."


"Wow!",
"Party’s over."


"What a disaster. ",
"Jake!!"


"Sam?",
"Sweetheart?",
"Daddy?",
"Hey kiddo.",
"What’s wrong?",
"Everything’s fine.",
"I was just upstairs and I couldn’t sleep.",
"I feel like a real jerk, honey.",
"We forgot your birthday.",
"I bet you’re really P.O.’d huh?",
"No, it’s okay.",
"I’m not really all that upset anymore.",
"This wedding is really turning this entire house inside out, and I just came down to tell you that we did remember.",
"Thanks Dad.",
"Happy Birthday.",
"Is something else wrong?",
"No, why?",
"I don’t know, I just get the feeling that something’s bothering you, something other than your birthday.",
"No, I’m fine, really.",
"I think I know what it is.",
"It has to do with a certain guy.",
"I know, honey, I know.",
"We’re all upset Jenny’s marrying the bohunk.",
"What’s the matter?",
"I meant Jake.",
"Jake?",
"Wait a minute, I thought she said his name was Rudy.",
"Forget it.",
"Forget what?",
"Who’s Jake?",
"He’s a boy, daddy.",
"It’s nothing.",
"Just forget it, please.",
"Come on, Sam.",
"We’re not communicating.",
"It’s extremely embarrassing, okay?",
"What’s embarrassing?",
"Sitting in the dark with your Dad telling him about your love life.",
"I’m afraid you lost me again, Sam.",
"Jake is a Senior, and he’s beautiful and perfect, and I like him a real lot, and he doesn’t like me, okay?",
"Oh.",
"And he’s got this incredible girlfriend.",
"I’m just ridiculous dork that’s following him around like a puppy.",
"Why do you think you’re a dork?",
"I don’t think you’re a dork.",
"I don’t think Mom thinks you’re a dork.",
"Mike thinks I’m a dork.",
"Mike is a dork.",
"So am I.",
"Well, if it’s any consolation, I love you.",
"And if this guy can’t see in you all the beautiful and wonderful things that I see, then he’s got the problem.",
"I know, it just hurts.",
"That’s why they call them crushes.",
"If they were easy they’d call them something else.",
"If I was Jenny I’d have this guy crawling on his knees.",
"Let me tell you something about Jenny.",
"Now I love her as much as I love you, but she’s a different person.",
"Sometimes I worry about her.",
"You know when you’re given things kind of easily you don’t always appreciate them.",
"With you I’m not worried.",
"And when it happens to you Samantha, it’ll be forever.",
"Well, I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep if I don’t feel this little talk has helped you.",
"So would you be a sport and lie to me.",
"Yeah sure, Daddy.",
"Good night, sweetheart.",
"Good night.",
"Oh, one more thing, sweetheart.",
"What?",
"When you do find the right guy, don’t let him boss you around.",
"Make sure he knows you wear the pants in the family."


"These are really hers?",
"Yeah.",
"How did you get ‘em?",
"She gave ‘em to me.",
"Did you...",
"No.",
"She cranked for you.",
"I told her you asked about her, right.",
"The girl freaked.",
"She had a hissy.",
"She thinks you’re the cats meow.",
"Really?",
"She came up to me in the gym tonight.",
"She looked at me like I was a leper.",
"Girl will do that, Jake.",
"You know?",
"They know that guys are like in perpetual heat, right?",
"They know they shit, and they enjoy pumping us up.",
"It’s pure power politics.",
"I’m telling you. ",
"I thought she hated my guts.",
"Games, Jake.",
"Silly torturous games.",
"Sometimes I go a week without lunch because some bitch wants to borrow my lunch money.",
"Any halfway decent girl can rob me blind.",
"Because I’m too worked up to say no.",
"It’s heinous, I’m telling you.",
"You better not be dicking me around.",
"It’d be a major downer to try and get together with this girl and find out that she really does think I’m a slime.",
"Jake, would I dick you?",
"Let me put it to you this way, what happens to me if I dick you?",
"I’ll kick your ass.",
"Right!",
"So why would I lie?",
"But I feel compelled to mention to you, Jake, that if all you want off the girl is a piece of ass, I mean, I’ll either do it myself, or get someone bigger than me to kick your ass.",
"I mean, not many girls in contemporary American society today would give their underwear to help a geek like me.",
"I can get a piece of ass anytime I want.",
"Shit, I’ve got Caroline in the bedroom right now, passed out cold.",
"I could violate her ten different ways if I wanted to.",
"What are you waiting for?",
"I don’t know.",
"She’s beautiful and she’s built and all that, I’m just not interested anymore.",
"Does that really matter, guy?",
"Yeah it matters.",
"She’s totally insensitive.",
"Look what she did to my house.",
"She doesn’t know shit about love.",
"The only thing she cares about is partying.",
"I want a serious girlfriend.",
"Somebody I can love that’s gonna love me back.",
"Is that psycho? ",
"That’s beautiful, Jake.",
"You know I think a ton of guys feel the same way you do.",
"Really?",
"Yeah, they just don’t have the...the balls to admit it.",
"You know what I mean?",
"I mean, they’re just...they’re wimps.",
"Samantha is a...she’s really special.",
"I’ll make a deal with you.",
"You let me keep these, I’ll let you take Caroline home.",
"But you’ve got to make sure she gets home.",
"You can’t leave her in a parking lot somewhere.",
"Okay?",
"Jake, I’m only a Freshman.",
"So, she’s so blitzed she won’t know the difference.",
"Jake, I don’t have a car.",
"You can take mine.",
"Jake, I don’t have license.",
"I trust you.",
"Jake, I’d love to...I can’t.",
"Want a pretzel?",
"You sure?",
"Positive."


"This is, uh, your car, Jake?",
"No, this is my dad’s car.",
"You said you couldn’t drive a stick.",
"This is a mother....!",
"This is a Rolls Royce, Jake.",
"So?",
"So! I heard the grain alone cost five grand on this.",
"Five grand!",
"Do you have five grand?",
"I don’t have five grand.",
"Then don’t hit anything.",
"Don’t hit anything.",
"Do you want to do this or not.",
"No!",
"Who the hell...does he...",
"Who’s he?",
"That’s me.",
"Who’re you?",
"I’m him.",
"Oh. Okay.",
"Have fun.",
"Okay.",
"Jake, is your Dad a big man?",
"About six four.",
"Very nice."


"Oh sexy girlfriend!",
"Bonzai!",
"You think they liked us?",
"Definitely."


"Could you turn that music down a little bit?",
"I’m a first time driver.",
"I really need to concentrate.",
"Excuse me!",
"Stop that!",
"It looks like rain.",
"Better put the top up.",
"Will you stop that!",
"You could get us in a lot of trouble doing that!",
"This is a car!",
"It probably doesn’t have triple A on it or anything.",
"Buckle up, pooh bear.",
"I can’t believe you’re so popular and you’re acting like this.",
"Hello?",
"Oh, I don’t know, I’ll have to look.",
"Mr. Ryan are you in here.",
"Mr. Ryan’s not in right now.",
"My Christmas present to you.",
"Thank you.",
"No, you didn’t see it.",
"Thank you.",
"Now we’re both on the pill.",
"You gave me a birth control pill!",
"Do you have any idea what that’ll do to a guy my age?",
"I know exactly what it’ll do to a girl my age.",
"My first time in a car and you pull this shit.",
"And it makes it okay to be really super careless...",
"Look, we’re not going any further until you stop these childish antics.",
"Oh, don’t be such a poop!",
"On second thought...",
"I love you.",
"This is getting good."


"Ted, what the hell are you doing?",
"Are those jocks back?",
"Look, do you have any film in your camera?",
"What?",
"Take those ridiculous things off!",
"Do you have any film in your camera?",
"Sure.",
"Okay, you guys go get it and bring it outside.",
"Okay? Right out front.",
"What for?",
"Just get it and come on out front, okay?",
"U.F.O.?",
"It’s better.",
"Extraterrestrial?",
"It’s better, okay.",
"Just get it and come outside.",
"Female extraterrestrial?",
"It’s Better!!",
"Now shhh.",
"Better than a female extraterrestrial?",
"How do you tell if it’s a female?",
"Cause it’s got tits.",
"Well what makes them different from regular tits?",
"They got four.",
"Just get the camera."


"They’re such assholes.",
"It’s not my fault, you should check that out.",
"Why do you always have to argue?",
"I’m not arguing.",
"Yes you are.",
"I am not.",
"Yes you are.",
"I am not.",
"Every time we try to do this something...it’s always bitch, bitch, bitch...",
"Bitch is a female dog, and I’m not even.",
"What’s that supposed to mean?",
"Shit.",
"Shoot.",
"Ted, that’s a Rolls Royce.",
"Ted, that’s the Prom Queen.",
"You got two girls in one night.",
"I told you dudes I was hot.",
"Hot? Ted, you’re a legend.",
"Will you shut up!",
"People around here work, all right?",
"Now will you hurry up, I’m breaking like 30 major laws here.",
"You know, Ted, nobody’s gonna believe you.",
"That, my friends, are what the pictures are for.",
"Okay?",
"Are you guys ready?",
"Wait, hold on a second.",
"Do you guys know what you’re doing here or what?",
"All right, just a minute.",
"How does this look?",
"Very nice.",
"Wait a minutes, you know black and white would just capture the moment so nicely...",
"Oh...",
"Would you take the picture already!",
"You’re pissing me off, I’m telling you.",
"Smile, pumpkin.",
"What?",
"Oh, pictures!",
"Cheers!"


"Mike, go get dressed.",
"I can’t believe it.",
"Jenny’s not in the shower.",
"I wouldn’t go in there if I were you.",
"Grandpa Fred was in there for a half an hour.",
"It’s totally polluted.",
"Get dressed.",
"It’s your nose.",
"They never listen."


"What was he wearing?",
"Well...he was wearing a red argyle sweater, and tan trousers, and red shoes.",
"Hmmm...no he’s not retarded.",
"Now, what can I do to help?",
"Well, you could finish the French toast.",
"Good.",
"I’ll just open the doughnuts.",
"Good thinking.",
"Oops, don’t want to lose the nails.",
"Well, I’ll just wait until I hear from you.",
"Voila.",
"Breakfast is ready."


"Oh, Sam. Sam, I am so sorry about your birthday.",
"It’s okay, I’ll recover.",
"It’s important to you.",
"And yesterday morning you were trying to tell me.",
"It’s okay, Mom.",
"These things sometimes happen.",
"Oh, honey, I just feel miserable.",
"You’ll feel better.",
"Who died?",
"Uh, is there something you want to say to your sister?",
"What?",
"Are you kidding?",
"Where should I start?",
"I mean about her birthday, it was yesterday.",
"We all forgot.",
"Classic.",
"Deep down he’s really sorry.",
"No.",
"No, he’s not."


"I have to go to this wedding and look like Miss Pretty Princess in this dipshits bridesmaids dress.",
"I don’t even have one tenth of the bod to fill the stupid bust up.",
"So, what, should I just waste myself and spare the agony?",
"I was gonna tell you something, but maybe I shouldn’t.",
"It’s pretty bad.",
"You may as well, nothing could shock me anymore.",
"Last night at the dance my brother paid a buck to see your underwear.",
"Hate that rock and roll rubbish.",
"Well I’m afraid it’s here to stay, Howie."


"Sam, you’re dragging your dress honey.",
"Pick it up.",
"Come on, Jenny.",
"Hurry up sweetie.",
"God, you’re so slow.",
"Don’t fuss at your sister, it’s her wedding day.",
"Big deal.",
"All right, is everybody in?",
"Are you all right, Jenny?"


"Hey Howard, there’s your Chinaman.",
"Oh, thanks Fred.",
"Bye Dong.",
"What’s he doing on the ground there?",
"What’s happened?",
"Put a mirror in front of his mouth.",
"Howard!",
"He’s dead!",
"Oh shit!",
"I paid seven grand for a wedding and he’ll never see it.",
"Oh, watch your language Mr. Dirty Mouth.",
"Oh, thank God, he is still warm.",
"Oh good.",
"Oh, here, I’ll help you Howard.",
"Whoa, canine cologne.",
"Oooh...no more yanky my wanky.",

"Oh, why don’t you shut up, Fred.",
"Shut up.",
"Dong.",
"Dong! ",
"Dong.",
"Grandpa is talking to you.",
"Dong, where is my automobile?",
"Automobile?",
"Wreck!",
"Big wreck!",
"Why you little scuzbag!"


"Oh my, is everything all right?",
"I was afraid you’d had an accident.",
"I wish.",
"Her monthly bill came early.",
"Well, she’s fine, she just took a muscle relaxer.",
"Try four.",
"You didn’t.",
"Mother!"


"Damn mom, I’ve got my headgear on.",
"Will you wake up!",
"Where the hell am I?",
"I’ll tell you where you are if you tell me who you are.",
"I’m Farmer Ted.",
"You’re in the parking lot across the street from my church.",
"You own a church?",
"What happened?",
"I have no idea.",
"Did I do that to your hair?",
"At this point anything’s possible.",
"Um, did um, did we...",
"Yeah, I’m pretty sure.",
"Excuse me, but did...um...do you know if I enjoyed it.",
"Am I nuts, of course I enjoyed it.",
"I mean, um, what I meant was, uh...did you?",
"Hmmm.",
"You know, I have this weird feeling I did."


"Here drink this.",
"Come on!",
"Wow...do I feel funky.",
"Uh huh."


"Okay, I’m coming.",
"Oh, this place is so confusing!",
"Go away!",
"I call police!",
"Open the door.",
"No way, Jose!",
"Open the door!",
"You beat up my face!",
"You grabbed my nuts.",
"That you?",
"Yeah, that me.",
"Oh, so sorry.",
"I thought you my new style American girlfriend.",
"Forget it, man.",
"Just get Samantha.",

"Married?",
"Married.",

"It’s gonna be a piece of cake, Bren.",
"Um, Jenny, I’m really happy for you.",
"I’m sorry for being kind of a jerk, lately.",
"That’s really lovely, Sam.",
"I know you’ll have a great marriage."


"Jenny!",
"Holy shit.",
"She just had a cramp.",
"I don’t care what she’s got.",
"Look at her!",
"Will you please be quiet.",
"We don’t want to announce to everyone that she’s got her period.",
"I guess those guys who thought we had to get married feel really stupid right about now, huh, padre?",
"Love the teapot.",
"Could you move over.",
"I gotta rest.",
"It’s great to see you...what’s the matter?",
"Here!",
"Hi, I know you.",
"I can’t see with this thing on."

"Not even when I was a Freshman. ",
"Me neither.",
"You were pretty crazy.",
"I was?",
"Yeah.",

"Shit.",

"You wanna know what happened?",
"Buy the book!",
"Ted...",
"I’m sorry about getting you mixed up with that guy.",
"Oh, it’s okay.",
"It wasn’t too terrible.",
"Weird?",
"I’m really sorry about last night.",
"The party...lots of things.",
"You know, neither one of us is gonna die if it doesn’t happen for us.",
"That’s true.",
"I just don’t know right now.",
"But I’m covered, okay, I won’t get hurt.",
"Sure.",
"I leave it up to you.",
"Fine."


"Her veil.",
"Oh hi. My sister forgot her veil.",
"I know she wouldn’t want anything to happen to it.",
